# Tasks: AdminLTE 4 Widget Components

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-default-widgets/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, spec.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅, quickstart.md ✅

**Status**: All 85 tasks complete (100%). Card component enhanced with v2.1 features (2026-01-05).

**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED for behavior changes. Use pytest + pytest-django for component rendering tests and djlint for template linting.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

All paths relative to repository root `c:\Users\jennings\Documents\repos\django-mvp\`:

- **Components**: `mvp/templates/cotton/`
- **Tests**: `tests/`
- **Docs**: `docs/components/`

**Independent Test**: Render card with title="Card Title" and body content, verify header and body render correctly with collapse button

**Checkpoint**: All primary user stories (US1, US2, US3) should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Apply Consistent Styling Across Widgets (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Verify consistent Bootstrap 5 color schemes and utility class support across all widget components

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (info-box) can proceed after Phase 2 ✅
  - US2 (small-box) can proceed after Phase 2 ✅
  - US3 (card) can proceed after Phase 2 ✅
  - US4 (styling) depends on US1, US2, US3 completion
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Depends on US1, US2, US3 being complete (cross-cutting validation)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Component template before running tests
- All tests pass before documentation
- Documentation before moving to next story

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes:
  - **US1, US2, US3 can be worked on in parallel** by different developers
  - All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task T008: "Create test file tests/test_info_box.py with basic rendering test"
Task T009: "Add test for info box with variant attribute in tests/test_info_box.py"
Task T010: "Add test for info box with progress bar in tests/test_info_box.py"
Task T011: "Add test for info box with custom background and gradient in tests/test_info_box.py"
Task T012: "Add test for info box with custom classes in tests/test_info_box.py"
Task T013: "Add test for ARIA attributes on progress bar in tests/test_info_box.py"

# Then implement component sequentially (single file):
Task T014-T019: Implement info-box.html features
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (info-box)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (small-box)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both components independently in example dashboard
6. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Scope**: info-box + small-box = Complete dashboard metrics capability

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (info-box) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP Part 1!)
3. Add User Story 2 (small-box) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP Part 2!)
4. Add User Story 3 (card) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 (styling) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T007)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (info-box) - T008-T022
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (small-box) - T023-T038
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (card) - T039-T063
3. **Developer A**: User Story 4 (styling validation) - T064-T074 (after US1, US2, US3 complete)
4. **Team**: Polish phase together - T075-T085

---

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 85
- **Setup Phase**: 3 tasks
- **Foundational Phase**: 4 tasks (BLOCKING)
- **User Story 1 (info-box)**: 15 tasks (6 tests + 9 implementation)
- **User Story 2 (small-box)**: 16 tasks (7 tests + 9 implementation)
- **User Story 3 (card)**: 25 tasks (12 tests + 13 implementation)
- **User Story 4 (styling)**: 11 tasks (6 tests + 5 implementation)
- **Polish Phase**: 11 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 31 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 + Phase 4 = **38 tasks** (info-box + small-box only)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Run `poetry run pytest` frequently during implementation
- Run `poetry run djlint mvp/templates/cotton/ --check` after template changes
- Components must match AdminLTE 4 reference implementation exactly
- All components must pass WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
