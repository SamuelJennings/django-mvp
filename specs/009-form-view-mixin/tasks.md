# Tasks: Form View Mixin for Consistent Form Layouts

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/009-form-view-mixin/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Workflow**: Following Design-First approach - implement and verify design BEFORE writing tests. Tests are REQUIRED for behavior changes but come AFTER design verification. Use pytest + pytest-django for backend/integration and pytest-playwright for UI behavior. End-to-end tests with playwright are REQUIRED for all features. UI changes MUST be verified using chrome-devtools-mcp DURING implementation. Use context7 for up-to-date library documentation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Each story follows: Design → Implement → Verify → Test.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Add django-formset as optional dev dependency in pyproject.toml for renderer testing
- [X] T002 Install updated dependencies with poetry install to enable formset testing
- [X] T003 Add formset to INSTALLED_APPS in tests/settings.py for test suite

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T004 Create MVPFormViewMixin in mvp/views.py with form_renderer, page_title attributes and get_form_renderer() method
- [X] T005 Implement renderer detection logic in get_form_renderer() following priority: crispy → formset → django
- [X] T006 Implement renderer availability checking using app_is_installed() from mvp/utils.py
- [X] T007 Implement invalid renderer warning logging and fallback to django renderer
- [X] T008 Implement get_page_title() method returning page_title attribute
- [X] T009 Implement get_context_data() to inject page_title and form_renderer into context
- [X] T010 Set default template_name to mvp/form_view.html in mixin

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Demonstration Views (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Developers can explore working examples of form views demonstrating all supported rendering methods and configurations

## Dependencies Between User Stories

```text
User Story Dependencies (Phase execution order):

Phase 1 (Setup)
    ↓
Phase 2 (Foundational) ← MUST complete BEFORE any user story work
    ↓
    ├─→ Phase 3 (US1: Basic Form Rendering) 🎯 MVP - Independent
    │
    ├─→ Phase 4 (US2: Model Form Create Support) - Depends on US1 completion
    │
    ├─→ Phase 5 (US3: Model Form Edit Support) - Depends on US1 completion
    │
    └─→ Phase 6 (US4: Demonstration Views) - Depends on US1, US2 & US3 completion
        ↓
    Phase 7 (Polish & Cross-Cutting)
```

**MVP Scope**: Phase 1 (Setup) + Phase 2 (Foundational) + Phase 3 (US1) = Minimum viable product

**Parallel Opportunities**:

- Within Phase 1: All tasks can run in parallel (different dependencies)
- Within Phase 2: T004-T010 must be sequential (mixin logic depends on previous steps)
- Within Phase 3 (US1): T011-T012 can be parallel (different files), T029-T039 tests can be parallel
- Within Phase 4 (US2): T043-T046 can be parallel (different aspects), T051-T054 tests can be parallel
- Within Phase 5 (US3): T057-T060 can be parallel (different aspects), T066-T069 tests can be parallel
- Within Phase 6 (US4): T072-T076 can be parallel (different demo views), T088-T091 tests can be parallel
- Within Phase 7: T093-T096 documentation tasks can be parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP-First Delivery

1. **Phase 1-2**: Setup and foundation (blockers for everything)
2. **Phase 3 (US1)**: Basic form rendering with auto-detection - DELIVERABLE MVP
3. **Phase 4 (US2)**: Add model create support - INCREMENTAL RELEASE
4. **Phase 5 (US3)**: Add model edit support - INCREMENTAL RELEASE
5. **Phase 6 (US4)**: Add demonstrations - DOCUMENTATION RELEASE
6. **Phase 7**: Polish and finalize

### Incremental Testing

- Tests written AFTER design verification for each user story
- Each phase checkpoint verifies independent functionality
- Visual verification using chrome-devtools-mcp during implementation
- E2E tests validate complete user workflows at the end of each user story phase

### Risk Mitigation

- Add django-formset as dev dependency early (Phase 1) to enable testing all renderer paths
- Use chrome-devtools-mcp to verify form rendering visually before writing tests
- Keep template conditional logic simple (if/elif/else blocks) to reduce complexity
- Log warnings for invalid renderer configurations to aid debugging

## Task Count Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 104
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 3 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 7 tasks
- **Phase 3 (US1 - Basic Form Rendering)**: 32 tasks (11 implementation, 8 verification, 14 tests)
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Model Form Create Support)**: 14 tasks (4 implementation, 4 verification, 6 tests)
- **Phase 5 (US3 - Model Form Edit Support)**: 15 tasks (4 implementation, 5 verification, 6 tests)
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Demonstration Views)**: 21 tasks (9 implementation, 7 verification, 5 tests)
