# Tasks: Dashboard List View Mixin

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-dash-list-view/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Workflow**: Following Design-First approach - implement and verify design BEFORE writing tests. Visual verification using chrome-devtools-mcp IS REQUIRED per constitution (Principle VI). Comprehensive unit/integration/E2E tests (Phase 10) are OPTIONAL for this feature as most functionality already exists and is tested. However, the two critical bug fixes (T005, T006) SHOULD have test coverage. UI changes MUST be verified using chrome-devtools-mcp DURING implementation. Use context7 for up-to-date library documentation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Each story follows: Design → Implement → Verify.

**Important Note**: Most implementation already exists. This feature focuses on:

1. Fixing multi-word OR search (FR-020)
2. Fixing pagination footer context (FR-016-018)
3. Creating additional demo views
4. Writing comprehensive tests (optional)
5. Documentation

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Verify existing implementation and prepare for enhancements

- [ ] T001 Verify all mixin classes exist in mvp/views.py (SearchMixin, OrderMixin, SearchOrderMixin, ListItemTemplateMixin, MVPListViewMixin)
- [ ] T002 Verify list view template exists at mvp/templates/mvp/list_view.html
- [ ] T003 [P] Verify Cotton components exist (c-grid, c-list.search-widget, c-list.order-widget, c-sidebar.filter, c-list.empty)
- [ ] T004 [P] Verify existing demo view ListViewDemo in example/views.py with Product model

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Fix existing implementation gaps that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be fully functional

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 Fix multi-word OR search in mvp/views.py SearchMixin._apply_search() - split search term by any whitespace (space/tab/newline) and apply OR matching across all words and fields (FR-020)
- [X] T005a Write test for multi-word OR search in tests/test_list_view_mixins.py - verify "red car" matches records with "red" OR "car"
- [X] T006 Fix pagination footer context in mvp/templates/cotton/page/footer/pagination.html - update to use page_obj.start_index(), page_obj.end_index(), page_obj.paginator.count instead of DataTables variables (FR-016-018)
- [X] T006a Write test for pagination footer context in tests/integration/test_list_view_integration.py - verify correct variable usage

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Basic List Display (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Developers can create a simple list view with minimal configuration showing model data in a grid with automatic page title and pagination

**Independent Test**: Create a view mixing MVPListViewMixin with only model and list_item_template specified, verify: (1) page displays model verbose_name as title, (2) objects render in single-column grid, (3) pagination footer displays correctly with entry counts and navigation links

### Verification for User Story 1

- [X] T012 [US1] Add URL route for MinimalListViewDemo in example/urls.py
- [X] T013 [US1] Verify MinimalListViewDemo using chrome-devtools-mcp: check page title, single-column grid, pagination footer

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and verified independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Custom Grid Configuration (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Developers can control grid layout by setting grid attribute to create responsive multi-column layouts

**Independent Test**: Create a view with custom grid attribute (e.g., {"cols": 1, "md": 2, "lg": 3}), verify rendered output reflects specified grid configuration with correct column counts at different screen sizes

### Verification for User Story 2

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Search Functionality (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Developers add search_fields to view class and system automatically displays search bar in page header, users can search and see filtered results

**Independent Test**: Add search_fields to view class, verify search bar appears, enter search terms (including multi-word searches), confirm only matching records are displayed using OR matching

### Verification for User Story 3

- [X] T028 [US3] Verify search performance with 10,000+ records meets <500ms requirement (SC-002)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1, 2, AND 3 should all work independently

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Sorting/Ordering Controls (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Developers specify order_by fields and system automatically adds sorting dropdown in page header, users can sort by different fields in ascending/descending order

**Independent Test**: Add order_by fields to view, verify dropdown appears, select different sort options, confirm list reorders correctly with ascending/descending toggle

### Verification for User Story 4

- [X] T029 [US4] Verify OrderMixin provides get_order_by_choices() method that returns order_by attribute from mvp/views.py (FR-002)
- [X] T030 [US4] Verify OrderMixin._apply_ordering() applies selected ordering to queryset in mvp/views.py (FR-023)

- [X] T035 [US4] Verify BasicListViewDemo using chrome-devtools-mcp: check dropdown appears, test different sort selections, test ascending/descending toggle (FR-024)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1, 2, 3, AND 4 should all work independently

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Filter Sidebar Integration (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Developers use FilterView with MVPListViewMixin and system automatically detects filters, displays filter toggle in page header, opens sidebar with filter controls

**Independent Test**: Create FilterView with django-filter filters mixed with MVPListViewMixin, verify filter toggle appears, click to open sidebar, apply filters, confirm list updates accordingly

### Verification for User Story 5

- [X] T036 [US5] Verify list_view.html template detects FilterView by checking for filter or filterset_class in context
- [X] T037 [US5] Verify list_view.html template conditionally displays filter toggle button when filters are detected (FR-026)

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 8: Menu Structure Updates

**Purpose**: Update navigation menu to include all demo views

- [X] T043 Verify all menu items link to correct views using chrome-devtools-mcp navigation test

---

## Phase 9: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [X] T044 [P] Verify all get_* methods can override class attributes: get_page_title(), get_grid_config(), get_search_fields(), get_order_by_choices(), get_list_item_template() in mvp/views.py (FR-010)
- [X] T045 [P] Verify empty state displays correctly when queryset is empty using c-list.empty component (FR-031)

- [X] T052 [P] Verify non-existent search_fields raise clear error or are silently ignored (edge case: search_fields references non-existent model field)
- [X] T053 Verify all mixins (SearchMixin, OrderMixin, ListItemTemplateMixin) function correctly when used independently (FR-006)

---

## Phase 10: Testing (OPTIONAL - Additional Coverage)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel after Phase 2 (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order: US1 (P1) → US2 (P2) → US3 (P2) → US4 (P2) → US5 (P3)
- **Menu Structure (Phase 8)**: Depends on Phase 3-7 completion (all demo views must exist)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete
- **Testing (Phase 10)**: Optional additional coverage - can run after any phase completes (Phase 2 includes required tests for bug fixes)

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories - **This is the MVP**
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1, demonstrates grid configuration
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires multi-word OR search fix (T005)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent, demonstrates ordering
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent, demonstrates django-filter integration

### Within Each User Story

- Verification tasks before demo creation
- Demo creation before URL routing
- URL routing before chrome-devtools-mcp verification
- All verification complete before marking story complete

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: Tasks T003 and T004 can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Tasks T005 and T006 can run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 4 (US2)**: Tasks T015-T018 can all run in parallel (creating different demo classes)

**Phase 8 (Menu)**: Tasks T041 and T042 can run in parallel (different menu groups)

**Phase 9 (Polish)**: Tasks T044, T045, T046, T051, T052 can run in parallel (different concerns)

**Phase 10 (Testing)**: Most test writing tasks can run in parallel:

- All unit test tasks (T055-T059) can run in parallel
- All integration test tasks (T061-T062) can run in parallel
- All E2E test tasks (T064-T065) can run in parallel

**Cross-Phase Parallelism**: After Phase 2 completes, Phases 3-7 can proceed in parallel if multiple developers are available

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Recommended)

Start with **User Story 1 only** (Phase 3):

1. Complete Phase 1 (Setup verification)
2. Complete Phase 2 (Foundational fixes - T005, T006)
3. Complete Phase 3 (User Story 1 - Basic List Display)
4. Verify and validate before proceeding

This delivers immediate value: developers can create simple list views with minimal configuration.

### Incremental Delivery

After MVP, add features incrementally in priority order:

1. Phase 4 (US2 - Grid Configuration) - Visual enhancement
2. Phase 5 (US3 - Search) - Usability improvement
3. Phase 6 (US4 - Ordering) - Data navigation
4. Phase 7 (US5 - Filters) - Advanced filtering
5. Phase 8 (Menu Structure) - Navigation
6. Phase 9 (Polish) - Quality improvements
7. Phase 10 (Testing) - Optional comprehensive tests

### Parallel Development

If team capacity allows, after Phase 2:

- Developer A: US1 + US2 (Basic display and grid layouts)
- Developer B: US3 + US4 (Search and ordering)
- Developer C: US5 (Filter integration)
- Then reconvene for Phase 8-9
