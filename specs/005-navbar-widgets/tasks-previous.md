# Tasks: Main Navbar Widgets - Base & Generic Widgets

**Input**: Design documents from /specs/005-navbar-widgets/
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Scope**: This spec has been reduced to focus on foundational components only:

- **Base Widget Component** (foundation for all custom widgets)
- **Theme Switcher Widget** (generic widget with JavaScript)
- **Fullscreen Widget** (generic widget, simpler pattern)

**Deferred to Future Specs**:

- User Profile Widget
- Messages Widget
- Notifications Widget

**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED for behavior changes. Use pytest + pytest-django for backend/integration. End-to-end tests with playwright are REQUIRED for all features. UI changes MUST be verified using chrome-devtools-mcp. Use context7 for up-to-date library documentation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project structure, documentation setup, and dependency validation

- [ ] T001 Verify Bootstrap 5.3+ is available and django-easy-icons is configured in base.html
- [ ] T002 Verify AdminLTE 4 CSS/JS are loaded from CDN in base.html
- [ ] T003 [P] Create mvp/templates/cotton/navbar/widgets/ directory structure
- [ ] T004 [P] Create tests/test_navbar_base_widget.py for base widget tests

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T005 Create documentation structure in docs/navbar-widgets.md with placeholders for all three widgets
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup test fixtures in tests/conftest.py for widget rendering tests
- [ ] T007 [P] Verify django-cotton 2.3+ component loading works correctly

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Base Widget Component (Priority: P1)  MVP

**Goal**: Create reusable base widget component that provides foundation for all navbar widgets

**Independent Test**: Create a custom widget using base component with icon, badge, and dropdown content. Verify AdminLTE styling and Bootstrap dropdown behavior.

### Tests for User Story 1

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T026 [US1] Use chrome-devtools-mcp to verify dropdown opens on click with custom content
- [ ] T027 [US1] Use chrome-devtools-mcp to verify badge colors (danger, warning, info, success)

### Documentation for User Story 1

- [ ] T028 [US1] Document base widget props (icon, badge_count, badge_color) in docs/navbar-widgets.md
- [ ] T029 [US1] Document base widget slots (default slot for dropdown) in docs/navbar-widgets.md
- [ ] T030 [US1] Add usage example for custom widget in docs/navbar-widgets.md
- [ ] T031 [US1] Add base widget example to example/templates/example/navbar_widgets.html

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (Base Widget) MUST complete before User Stories 2 & 3
  - User Stories 2 (Theme Switcher) and 3 (Fullscreen) can proceed in parallel after US1
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (Base Widget - P1)**: Foundation for all widgets - MUST complete first
- **User Story 2 (Theme Switcher - P1)**: Depends on US1 (uses base widget) - High priority
- **User Story 3 (Fullscreen - P2)**: Depends on US1 (uses base widget) - Can run parallel with US2

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Component implementation before JavaScript (where applicable)
- JavaScript before UI verification
- UI verification before documentation
- All tests must pass before moving to next story

### Parallel Opportunities

#### Phase 1 (Setup)

- T003 (directory structure) + T004 (test file creation) can run in parallel

#### Phase 2 (Foundational)

- T006 (test fixtures) + T007 (Cotton verification) can run in parallel

#### Phase 3 (User Story 1 - Base Widget)

- T008-T014: All tests can be written in parallel
- T024-T027: All UI verification tasks can run in parallel after implementation
- T028-T031: All documentation tasks can run in parallel

#### Phase 4 (User Story 2 - Theme Switcher)

- T032-T041: All tests can be written in parallel (component tests + JS tests)
- T042 (component) + T047 (JS file creation) can start in parallel
- T057-T063: All UI verification tasks can run in parallel after implementation
- T064-T069: All documentation tasks can run in parallel

#### Phase 5 (User Story 3 - Fullscreen)

- T070-T074: All tests can be written in parallel
- T075 (component creation) can start immediately after US1 complete
- T081-T085: All UI verification tasks can run in parallel after implementation
- T086-T090: All documentation tasks can run in parallel

#### Phase 6 (Polish)

- T094-T098: All documentation tasks can run in parallel
- T104-T106: All E2E tests can be written in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Base Widget)

After foundational phase completes, here's how US1 tasks can be parallelized:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Write all tests in parallel (one developer can do these sequentially)
poetry run pytest tests/test_navbar_base_widget.py  # All should FAIL initially

# Terminal 2: Implement base widget component
# Edit: mvp/templates/cotton/navbar/widgets/index.html
# (T015-T022 done sequentially by one developer)

# Terminal 3: After implementation, verify tests pass
poetry run pytest tests/test_navbar_base_widget.py -v  # All should PASS now

# Terminal 4: UI verification (can be done in parallel after impl)
# Use chrome-devtools-mcp for T024-T027

# Terminal 5: Documentation (can be done in parallel with UI verification)
# T028-T031: Update docs and examples
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (Minimum Viable Product)

For initial release, implement:

- **User Story 1 (Base Widget)** - Required foundation
- **User Story 2 (Theme Switcher)** - High user value, demonstrates complete pattern
- **User Story 3 (Fullscreen)** - Optional but recommended (demonstrates simpler widget pattern)

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Sprint 1**: Phase 1-3 (Setup + Foundational + Base Widget) - Delivers foundation
2. **Sprint 2**: Phase 4 (Theme Switcher) - Delivers first complete widget with JS
3. **Sprint 3**: Phase 5 (Fullscreen) - Delivers simpler widget pattern example
4. **Sprint 4**: Phase 6 (Polish) - Documentation, E2E tests, integration

### Risk Mitigation

- Test theme switcher localStorage handling early (localStorage might be blocked)
- Verify Fullscreen API browser support (not available in all browsers)
- Test dropdown behavior on mobile devices (touch interactions)
- Validate AdminLTE fullscreen plugin integration (verify it exists in AdminLTE 4)

---

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] **SC-001**: Developers can add any widget in under 5 lines of template code
- [ ] **SC-002**: All widgets render correctly on mobile (320px), tablet (768px), desktop (1200px+)
- [ ] **SC-003**: Theme switcher changes theme in under 100ms with no flicker
- [ ] **SC-004**: Widget dropdowns open/close with smooth AdminLTE animations
- [ ] **SC-005**: Badge counters display correctly for values 0 to 999+
- [ ] **SC-006**: Fullscreen toggle works with single click and reflects state
- [ ] **SC-007**: All widgets have ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- [ ] **SC-008**: Theme preference persists across browser sessions and page reloads
- [ ] **SC-009**: Documentation provides complete examples for each widget type
- [ ] **SC-010**: Test coverage includes unit tests for components and integration tests for JS

---

## Summary

**Total tasks**: 111
**Phases**: 6 (Setup + Foundation + 3 User Stories + Polish)
**Test tasks**: 33 (30%)
**Implementation tasks**: 55 (50%)
**Documentation tasks**: 15 (13%)
**Quality/verification tasks**: 8 (7%)

**Scope Reduction**:

- **Removed**: User Profile, Messages, Notifications widgets
- **Retained**: Base Widget (foundation), Theme Switcher (full-featured), Fullscreen (simple pattern)
- **Benefit**: Focused scope, faster delivery, clearer foundation for future widgets

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-4 (T001-T069) = Foundation + Base Widget + Theme Switcher
**Full Feature**: All phases = 100%
