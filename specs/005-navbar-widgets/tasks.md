# Implementation Tasks: Main Navbar Widgets - Base & Generic Widgets

**Feature**: Main Navbar Widgets
**Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Plan**: [plan.md](plan.md)
**Branch**: `005-navbar-widgets`
**Generated**: January 15, 2026

**Scope**: This specification has been reduced to focus on foundational components only:

- **Base Widget Component** (US1) - Foundation for all custom navbar widgets
- **Theme Switcher Widget** (US2) - Generic widget with JavaScript for theme persistence
- **Fullscreen Widget** (US3) - Generic widget using AdminLTE fullscreen plugin

**Deferred**: User Profile, Messages, Notifications widgets

## Task Format

All tasks follow this strict format:

```
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
```

- **Checkbox**: `- [ ]` (markdown task checkbox)
- **Task ID**: T001, T002, etc. (sequential execution order)
- **[P] marker**: Present ONLY if task can run in parallel (different files, no blockers)
- **[Story] label**: [US1], [US2], [US3] for user story tasks; omit for setup/foundational/polish
- **Description**: Clear action with explicit file path

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project structure, documentation setup, and dependency validation

- [X] T001 Verify Bootstrap 5.3+ is available and django-easy-icons is configured in base.html
- [X] T002 Verify AdminLTE 4 CSS/JS are loaded from CDN in base.html

- [X] T004 [P] Create mvp/templates/cotton/navbar/widgets/ directory structure
- [X] T005 [P] Create tests/test_navbar_base_widget.py for base widget tests

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

## Dependencies

### Phase Dependencies

```mermaid
graph TD
    P1[Phase 1: Setup] --> P2[Phase 2: Foundational]
    P2 --> P3[Phase 3: Base Widget US1]
    P3 --> P4[Phase 4: Theme Switcher US2]
    P3 --> P5[Phase 5: Fullscreen US3]
    P4 --> P6[Phase 6: Polish]
    P5 --> P6
```

### Critical Path

1. **Phase 1 → Phase 2** (BLOCKING): Must complete setup and foundational before ANY user stories
2. **Phase 2 → Phase 3** (BLOCKING): Base widget MUST be complete before other widgets
3. **Phase 3 → Phase 4/5** (PARALLEL): Theme Switcher and Fullscreen can run in parallel
4. **Phase 4/5 → Phase 6** (MERGE): Both user stories must complete before polish

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (Base Widget)**: No dependencies after Phase 2
- **User Story 2 (Theme Switcher)**: Depends on User Story 1 (extends base widget)
- **User Story 3 (Fullscreen)**: Depends on User Story 1 (extends base widget)

---

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 1 (Setup)

```bash
# All setup tasks can run in parallel after T001-T002
poetry run pytest tests/ &  # Verify tests work
mkdir -p mvp/templates/cotton/navbar/widgets &
touch tests/test_navbar_base_widget.py
```

### Phase 2 (Foundational)

```bash
# T007 and T008 can run in parallel
poetry run pytest tests/conftest.py &
poetry run python -c "import django_cotton; print('Cotton OK')"
```

### Phase 3 (User Story 1 - Base Widget)

All tests T009-T017 can be written in parallel:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Icon tests
# T009, T010

# Terminal 2: Badge tests
# T011, T012, T014, T015, T017

# Terminal 3: Slot and pattern tests
# T013, T016
```

E2E tests T031-T035 can run in parallel after implementation.

### Phase 4 (User Story 2 - Theme Switcher)

Component tests T036-T040 and JS tests T041-T047 can be written in parallel.

Component implementation T048-T053 and JS implementation T054-T062 can run in parallel (different files).

E2E tests T069-T075 can run in parallel after implementation.

### Phase 5 (User Story 3 - Fullscreen)

All tests T076-T080 can be written in parallel.

E2E tests T091-T094 can run in parallel after implementation.

### Phase 6 (Polish)

All documentation tasks T095-T103 can run in parallel.

Integration tasks T109-T112 can run in parallel after code quality checks pass.

---

## MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product** = Phases 1-4

Delivers:

- Base widget component with icon, badge, {{ slot }} support
- Theme switcher with localStorage persistence
- Complete test coverage (unit + E2E)
- Basic usage documentation

**Estimated Time**: 10-14 hours

**Tasks Included**: T001-T075 (75 tasks)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Test-First Workflow (Per Phase)

1. Write ALL tests for the phase FIRST (tests should FAIL)
2. Run tests to verify they fail: `poetry run pytest tests/test_*.py`
3. Implement feature code to make tests pass
4. Run tests again to verify: `poetry run pytest tests/test_*.py`
5. Run UI verification with chrome-devtools-mcp
6. Run E2E tests with playwright: `poetry run pytest tests/e2e/`
7. Move to next phase

### Icon Implementation Pattern

**ALWAYS use c-icon component:**

```html
<!-- ✅ CORRECT -->
<c-icon name="theme_light" class="nav-icon" />
<c-icon name="maximize" aria-hidden="true" />

<!-- ❌ WRONG - Never use direct <i> tags -->
<i class="bi bi-sun"></i>
```

**Required aliases in EASY_ICONS:**

- `theme_light` → `bi bi-sun`
- `maximize` → `bi bi-arrows-fullscreen`
- `minimize` → `bi bi-arrows-angle-contract`

### Cotton Slot Pattern

**In component definition:**

```html
<!-- mvp/templates/cotton/navbar/widgets/index.html -->
<div class="dropdown-menu">
  {{ slot }}  <!-- Default slot: content injected here -->
</div>
```

**When using component:**

```html
<c-navbar.widgets icon="theme_light" badge_count="5">
  <div class="dropdown-item">Content goes into {{ slot }}</div>
</c-navbar.widgets>
```

---

## Success Criteria

All tasks complete when:

- ✅ All 112 tasks checked off
- ✅ All pytest tests passing (>90% coverage)
- ✅ All playwright E2E tests passing
- ✅ All linting checks pass (ruff, djlint)
- ✅ Documentation complete with examples
- ✅ All widgets working in development server
- ✅ Mobile responsive (320px-1200px+)
- ✅ All icon aliases use c-icon component
- ✅ All slots use {{ slot }} Django variable syntax

---

## Notes

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Icon Component**: ALWAYS use `<c-icon name="alias" />`, never direct `<i>` tags
2. **Cotton Slots**: Use `{{ slot }}` Django variables in components, `<c-slot name="...">` when calling
3. **Theme Switcher**: Uses localStorage with graceful degradation to session-only
4. **Fullscreen**: Uses AdminLTE's data-lte-toggle plugin, not custom JavaScript
5. **Badge Logic**: Hide when zero, display "99+" when > 99
6. **Test-First**: ALL tests written before implementation, must see them fail first

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Using direct `<i class="bi-*">` tags instead of c-icon component
- ❌ Using `<c-slot />` syntax in component definitions (use `{{ slot }}` Django variable)
- ❌ Implementing before tests are written and failing
- ❌ Skipping UI verification with chrome-devtools-mcp
- ❌ Not testing localStorage unavailable scenario for theme switcher
- ❌ Forgetting ARIA labels on icon-only widgets

### Future Enhancements (Deferred)

The following features are explicitly out of scope for this implementation:

- User Profile Widget (requires authentication context)
- Messages Widget (requires messaging backend)
- Notifications Widget (requires notification system)
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- AJAX-based dropdown content loading
- Custom theme color definitions
- Widget reordering/customization UI

These will be addressed in future specifications once the foundational pattern is established.
