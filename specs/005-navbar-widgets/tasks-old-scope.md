**Code Quality**: ruff formatted, djlint applied ✅
**Documentation**: README.md updated, comprehensive navbar-widgets.md created ✅
**Example Integration**: All 6 widgets integrated into example app ✅

**Remaining Tasks**:

- E2E Tests (T030-T033, T048-T051, T066-T068, T085-T088, T108-T110): Deferred (requires pytest-playwright installation)
- Coverage Analysis (T120-T121): Optional quality metrics

---

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-navbar-widgets/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED for behavior changes. Use pytest + pytest-django for backend/integration and pytest-playwright for UI behavior. End-to-end tests with playwright are REQUIRED for all features. UI changes MUST be verified using chrome-devtools-mcp. Use context7 for up-to-date library documentation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Widget components: `mvp/templates/cotton/navbar/widgets/`
- JavaScript: `mvp/static/js/navbar/`
- Tests: `tests/`
- Documentation: `docs/`

**Component Naming Convention:**

- Components are accessed as `<c-navbar.widgets.{name} />`
- Examples: `<c-navbar.widgets.user />`, `<c-navbar.widgets.notifications />`, `<c-navbar.widgets.avatar />`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - MVP priority
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational - MVP priority
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Phase 2 (avatars) - Can run with Phase 3/4
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Independent after Phase 1 - Can run parallel
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on Phase 2 - Reference implementation
- **User Story 6 (Phase 8)**: Independent after Phase 1 - Can run parallel
- **Documentation (Phase 9)**: Depends on all implementation phases

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses avatar system
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Setup (Phase 1) - Independent JavaScript
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses base widget
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Can start after Setup (Phase 1) - Independent JavaScript

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Component templates before JavaScript (if needed)
- Core implementation before UI verification
- UI verification before E2E tests
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

#### Phase 1 (Setup) - All tasks can run in parallel

```bash
# All Context7 documentation retrieval:
T001, T002, T003

# All project setup:
T006, T007 (T004, T005 create directories sequentially)
```

#### Phase 2 (Foundation) - Sequential critical path

```bash
# Must complete in order:
1. Base widget component (T008-T011)
2. Avatar system (T012-T015)
```

#### Phase 3-8 (MVP Widgets) - Can run parallel after Phase 2

```bash
# Terminal 1: User Widget (T016-T033)
# Terminal 2: Notifications Widget (T034-T051)
```

#### Phase 5-8 (All Widgets) - Can run parallel after Foundation

```bash
# Terminal 1: Messages (T052-T068)
# Terminal 2: Theme Switcher (T069-T088)
# Terminal 3: Custom Widget (T089-T097)
# Terminal 4: Fullscreen (T098-T110)
```

#### Phase 9 (Documentation) - Most tasks can run in parallel

```bash
# All documentation tasks: T111-T116
# All example integration tasks: T122-T125
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Write all tests first (in parallel):
pytest tests/test_user_widget.py::test_user_widget_renders  # T016
pytest tests/test_user_widget.py::test_initials_display  # T017
pytest tests/test_user_widget.py::test_avatar_fallback  # T018
pytest tests/test_user_widget.py::test_mobile_responsive  # T019
pytest tests/test_user_widget.py::test_dropdown_sections  # T020

# Create all component templates (in parallel):
# T021: user_widget.html
# T022: user_header.html
# T023: user_body.html
# T024: user_footer.html
# T026: user-widget.css

# Then: T025 (JavaScript depends on templates)
# Then: T027-T029 (UI verification)
# Then: T030-T033 (E2E tests)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T015) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T016-T033)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T034-T051)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both widgets independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-4 (Tasks T001-T051) = ~40% of total work
**Time estimate**: ~12-16 hours

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Widget (US1) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add Notifications (US2) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add Messages (US3) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add Theme Switcher (US4) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Add Custom Widget (US5) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7. Add Fullscreen (US6) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (US1)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (US2)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (US3)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (US4)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

- **E2E Testing (playwright)**: T030-T033, T048-T051, T066-T068, T085-T088, T108-T110 (18 tasks)

**Parallel opportunities**:

- Phase 1: 3 of 7 tasks
- Phase 2: Sequential (critical path)
- Phases 3-4: Both MVP widgets can proceed in parallel
- Phases 5-8: All 4 phases can run in parallel after Foundation
- Phase 9: Most documentation tasks

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-4 (T001-T051) = Foundation + User + Notifications
**Full Feature**: All phases = 100%

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- UI changes MUST be verified using chrome-devtools-mcp
- Use context7 to retrieve latest library documentation
- All E2E tests use playwright
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies
