# Specification Quality Checklist: Configurable Site Navigation Menu System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: January 7, 2026
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Iteration 1** - January 7, 2026

All checklist items pass validation. The specification:

- Maintains technology-agnostic language throughout
- Focuses on what users need (developers using django-mvp) rather than how to implement
- Provides clear, testable requirements with measurable success criteria
- Identifies edge cases and boundaries appropriately
- Documents assumptions and out-of-scope items
- Contains no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements can be implemented with reasonable defaults
- Defines clear user stories with independent test criteria and priorities

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

## Notes

The specification successfully defines a configurable menu system without prescribing implementation details. All requirements are testable and success criteria are measurable without requiring knowledge of the underlying technology stack.
